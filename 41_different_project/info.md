Day 39 and 40 were a capstone project to use an API to track flights. I did something VERY similar and the specific API is broken at the moment.
Days 41-44 are dedicated to HTML and CSS, which I already have a good grip of.

Instead, I will work on a personal project and use this week to see how far I can get before publishing it on GitHub.
